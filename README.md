In order to run the application make sure you have a database **users_db** created into mysql after creating the database please follow the steps <br>

0. Please clone this repository using git clone and cd into the directory

## Features of The API
1. User can register using the credentials and the password is encrypted before storing into the database
2. User can login using the email and a OTP is sent to the specified mail ( Here I am using nodemailers Test Account to send mails) however in production environment we can use API's like **SendGrid or MailGun**
3. OTP is sent and the otp can be viewed at by the address wriiten on the terminal 
4. User enters the OTP and the Dashboard is rendered indicating succesfull login
5. Server logs in case server crashes , that can be helpful to find the fault
